## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm flipfloppy. (he/him)

### Current projects 

* [VidentiUI](https://github.com/flipfloppy1/VidentiUI), an open-source UI library for games.
* Ludus, a voxel game with combat, exploration and lore. (More on that on [my blog](https://flipfloppy1.github.io/) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@flipfloppy1)! (eventually))

I'm an avid developer with an interest in writing robust and speedy code using C++, and I've recently begun to learn Lua and Vim. 

### Collaboration
If you're interested in contributing to VidentiUI, whether through ideas or code, let me know!

### Contact
You can reach me privately at flipfloppy.business@gmail.com, or if you have any questions about my open-source projects, feel free to let me know there (in discussions, or in issues if it's an issue).
